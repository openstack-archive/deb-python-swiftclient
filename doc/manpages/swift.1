.SH NAME
.LP
.B swift
\- OpenStack Swift client tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift
[options] <command> [args]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBswift\fR tool is a command line utility for communicating with
an OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) environment. It allows one to perform
several types of operations.

.SH COMMANDS
.PP

\fBstat\fR [\fIcommand-options\fR] [\fIcontainer\fR] [\fIobject\fR]
.RS 4
Displays information for the account, container, or object depending on the args given (if any).
In verbose mode, the Storage URL and the authentication token are displayed
as well. Option \-\-lh reports sizes in human readable format similar to ls \-lh.
.RE

\fBlist\fR [\fIcommand-options\fR] [\fIcontainer\fR]
.RS 4
Lists the containers for the account or the objects for a container.
The \-p <prefix> or \-\-prefix <prefix> is an option that will only list items beginning
with that prefix. The \-d <delim> or \-\-delimiter <delim> is option
(for container listings only) that will roll up items with the given
delimiter (see OpenStack Swift general documentation for what this means).

The \-l or \-\-long and \-\-lh options provide more detail, similar to ls \-l and ls \-lh, the latter
providing sizes in human readable format (eg 3K, 12M, etc). These latter 2 switches
use more overhead to get those details, which is directly proportional to the number
of container or objects being listed. With the \-t or \-\-total option they only report totals.
.RE

\fBupload\fR [\fIcommand-options\fR] container file_or_directory [\fIfile_or_directory\fR] [...]
.RS 4
Uploads to the given container the files and directories specified by the
remaining args. The \-c or \-\-changed is an option that will only upload files
that have changed since the last upload. The \-\-object\-name <object\-name> is
an option that will upload file and name object to <object\-name> or upload dir
and use <object\-name> as object prefix. The \-S <size> or \-\-segment\-size <size>
and \-\-leave\-segments and others are options as well (see swift upload \-\-help for more).
.RE

\fBpost\fR [\fIcommand-options\fR] [\fIcontainer\fR] [\fIobject\fR]
.RS 4
Updates meta information for the account, container, or object depending
on the args given. If the container is not found, it will be created
automatically; but this is not true for accounts and objects. Containers
also allow the \-r (or \-\-read\-acl) and \-w (or \-\-write\-acl) options. The \-m
or \-\-meta option is allowed on all and used to define the user meta data
items to set in the form Name:Value. This option can be repeated.
For more details and options see swift post \-\-help.
\fBExample\fR: post \-m Color:Blue \-m Size:Large
.RE

\fBcopy\fR [\fIcommand-options\fR] \fIcontainer\fR \fIobject\fR
.RS 4
Copies an object to a new destination or adds user metadata to the object (current
user metadata will be preserved, in contrast with the post command) depending
on the args given. The \-\-destination option sets the destination in the form
/container/object. If not set, the object will be copied onto itself which is useful
for adding metadata. The \-M or \-\-fresh\-metadata option copies the object without
the existing user metadata. The \-m or \-\-meta option is always allowed and is used
to define the user metadata items to set in the form Name:Value (this option
can be repeated).
For more details and options see swift copy \-\-help.
.RE

\fBdownload\fR [\fIcommand-options\fR] [\fIcontainer\fR] [\fIobject\fR] [\fIobject\fR] [...]
.RS 4
Downloads everything in the account (with \-\-all), or everything in a
container, or a list of objects depending on the args given. For a single
object download, you may use the \-o [\-\-output] <filename> option to
redirect the output to a specific file or if "-" then just redirect to stdout or
with \-\-no-download actually not to write anything to disk.
The \-\-ignore-checksum is an option that turns off checksum validation.
You can specify optional headers with the repeatable cURL-like option
\-H [\-\-header]. For more details and options see swift download \-\-help.
.RE

\fBdelete\fR [\fIcommand-options\fR] [\fIcontainer\fR] [\fIobject\fR] [\fIobject\fR] [...]
.RS 4
Deletes everything in the account (with \-\-all), or everything in a container,
or all objects in a container that start with a given string (given by \-\-prefix),
or a list of objects depending on the args given. Segments of manifest objects
will be deleted as well, unless you specify the \-\-leave\-segments option.
For more details and options see swift delete \-\-help.
.RE

\fBcapabilities\fR [\fIcommand-options\fR] [\fIproxy-url\fR]
.RS 4
Displays cluster capabilities. If the proxy-url option is not provided the
storage-url retrieved after authentication is used as proxy-url.

By default, the output includes the list of the activated Swift middlewares as
well as relevant options for each one. Additionally the command displays
relevant options for the Swift core.

The \-\-json option will print a json representation of the cluster
capabilities. This is typically more suitable for consumption by other
programs, such as jq.

\fBExample\fR: capabilities https://swift.example.com
         capabilities \-\-json
.RE

\fBtempurl\fR [\fIcommand-option\fR] \fImethod\fR \fIseconds\fR \fIpath\fR \fIkey\fR
.RS 4
Generates a temporary URL allowing unauthenticated access to the Swift object
at the given path, using the given HTTP method, for the given number of
seconds, using the given TempURL key. With the optional \-\-prefix\-based option a
prefix-based URL is generated. If optional \-\-absolute argument is
provided, seconds is instead interpreted as a Unix timestamp at which the URL
should expire. \fBExample\fR: tempurl GET $(date \-d "Jan 1 2016" +%s)
/v1/AUTH_foo/bar_container/quux.md my_secret_tempurl_key \-\-absolute

.RE

\fBauth\fR
.RS 4
Display auth related authentication variables in shell friendly format.
For examples see swift auth \-\-help.
