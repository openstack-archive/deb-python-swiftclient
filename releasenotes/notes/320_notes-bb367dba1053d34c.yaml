features:
  - >
    Added Keystone session support and a "v1password" plugin for Keystone.
    This plugin provides a way for Keystone sessions (and clients that
    use them, like python-openstackclient) to communicate with old auth
    endpoints that still use this mechanism.

  - >
    HEAD, GET, and DELETE now support sending additional headers to match
    existing functionality on PUT requests.

  - Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
